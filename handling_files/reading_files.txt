Reading files

- reading files is a sequential opration.
	- when file is opened, point to a position 0, the start.
	- Each succesive readline() moves forward
- fh.seek(n) - moves pointer to position n
- block - fh.read(12) -  read a fixed number of characters.

- when reading a file increamentaly, important to know when a file has ended.
- the following both signal end of file
	- fh.read() retuns empty string 
	- fh.readline() returns emplty string
